This is where all of my trips will show up.

<!-- authorization is not implemented, a user not signed in should only have access to landing page-->
<!-- when a user logs out and different user logs in, the old user's name shows up until page is refreshed -->
<!-- the app breaks when a trip is made without the origin field  -->
<ul>
  <li ng-repeat="trip in tripListVm.trips | filter: {createdBy: tripListVm.currentUser._id}">
    <a ui-sref="tripsShow({id: trip._id})">{{trip.location}}</a>, {{trip.startDate | date: 'MM/dd/yy'}} - {{trip.endDate | date: 'MM/dd/yy'}}
  </li>
</ul>

<a ui-sref="tripsNew">Add New Trip</a>
